## Getting Started

To run this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, navigate to both directories and install the required dependencies.

Open your terminal and run the following commands:


# For the AirportCase directory

In separate terminal windows, run the following commands to start the application and the backend server:
